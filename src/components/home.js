        <p>I am a front-end developer who is constantly learning. I love clean design, clean code, and all things modern JavaScript (particularly React).</p>
        
        <p>I'm somewhat early in my journey, but committed to growth and learning from others.</p>

        <p>If you’re curious, check out some of my past and current projects, read some of my posts, or learn a bit more about me.</p>

        <p>And of course, I’m friendly and would love to hear from you :)</p>
